                                    So when he straps on a gun belt one night to head across town and snuff out a character named Jim Denny, well, you might guess that ol’ Jim had it coming. Maybe he didn’t, maybe he did…

                            <h2>Transcript of Episode</h2>

                                <p>When Andy Griffith passed away in 2012, CNN covered his death off-and-on the entire day.</p>

                                <p>You’ve all seen this type of news coverage before – an overview of the career, images of the star in their prime, phone-in conversations with other celebrities who were close with the departed. Larry King is one of the people who called in to talk that day. He’d had Andy on his various shows numerous times – and he mentioned something in passing that’s really interesting…</p>
                                    
                                <p>What Larry said, is that a lawyer named Percy Foreman was the man who inspired the character Matlock. This was a weird thing for anyone to say because most people, even today, believe that character to be based on a different lawyer named Bobby Lee Cook. However, in 2015, three years after Larry King said something that most people would assume was incorrect, the creator of Matlock did confirm that the character was based on Percy Foreman.</p>

                                </figure>

                                <p>A criminal defense attorney from Houston, Texas, Percy lost only 53 of the 1500 cases where clients of his faced the death penalty, with only 1 of those losses resulting in an actual execution. Percy was able to achieve this record by being an incredible lawyer, no denying it. But also due to the Texas court system’s practice of using juries to determine guilt as well as sentencing in the case of a guilty verdict.</p>

                                <p>So, instead of one judge – who’s heard it all before – determining his client’s fate, Percy had 12 average citizens from the local community sitting right there, waiting to be convinced that the victim in this situation wasn’t a victim at all.</p>
                                    
                                <p>They were up to no good!</p>
                                    
                                <p>The community was far better off without that element in it!</p>
                                    
                                <p>Even if his client had killed ‘em, well, Hell… They needed killing!</p>
                                    
                                <p>Foreman called it Misdemeanor Murder. That’s where a jury might convict you of ending another person’s life and send you on your way with the type of punishment you’d receive for a misdemeanor crime, often nothing more than probation. No time, at all. It’s essentially a sanctioned form of vigilante justice.</p>
                                    
                                <p>Percy Foreman had such a long run of wins with this strategy that it’s still being used in Texas today. People who have conversations about this sort of thing will sometimes refer to it as The Texas Defense… </p>
                                
                            <h2>Jim Denny</h2>

                                <p>Now, Jim Denny… wasn’t from Texas.</p>

                                <p>He was from Tennessee.</p>
                                    
                                <p>The Buffalo Valley area, about 60 miles east of Nashville, was a real poor area in which to be born in 1911. When a 16 year old Jim Denny got hired to work the mailroom of WSM Radio’s parent company, he must have seen it as an opportunity to make something out of himself.Now, Jim Denny… wasn’t from Texas.</p>   
                               
                                <figure>
                                    <img src="Jim-Denny-with-Jim-Reeves.jpeg" alt="Jim Denny and Jim Reeves pose with an LP behind a desk.">

                                </figure>

                                <p>There are a few funny things from Jim Denny’s time at the Grand Ole Opry…</p>

                                <p>Like, the one about Elvis Presley’s big debut…</p>
                                    
                                <p>Elvis was still a teenager when Denny did Sam Phillips the favor of letting Elvis come on the show to play his not-country arrangement of Blue Moon of Kentucky. It didn’t go well. Denny supposedly told Elvis backstage, “You ain’t goin’ nowhere, son. You ought to go back to drivin’ a truck.”</p>
                                    
                                <p>Denny’s also the guy who fired Hank Williams – over the telephone.</p>
                                    
                                <p>And there’s the time when Jim made Johnny Cash wait outside his office for 2 hours before letting him in to ask why Cash should be allowed to play on the Opry. Cash mentioned that he presently had a song called “I Walk the Line” in the top ten…</p>
                                    
                                <p>Jim Denny was what many people referred to in those times as a “hard man.”</p>
                                    
                                <p>Today, I think they’d have some different words for him.</p>
                                    
                                <p>And that’s why Ernest Tubb tried to shoot him in 1957.</p>

                            <h2>Young Ernest</h2>

                                <p>It’s shocking to hear Ernest Tubb’s name associated with any kind of violence, whatsoever. There are plenty of stories about him and most of them are about how great a guy he was. He had an adorable nickname – “E.T.” – you can hear admiration in the voice of everyone who calls him that…</p>

                                <p>Crisp, TX is a ghost town now. Ernest Tubb was born there in 1914 – into a family of sharecroppers. Like most sharecroppers’ children, Ernest grew up working on farms all over the area. Long days in the field, entertainment from a stereo in the evenings, an early bedtime and you get back up the next day to do it all over again. Typical day for a sharecropper.</p>

                                <p>Like a great number of artists we’ll learn about in future episodes, it was all over for a 14-year-old Ernest Tubb the first time he heard Jimmie Rodgers sing. The obsession was instant and it would steer the course of the rest of his life. Hearing Jimmie Rodgers is what led Ernest Tubb to decide he simply had to become a country singer. It’s also – very specifically – what caused him, three decades later, to want to shoot a .357 magnum at Jim Denny.</p>

                                <p>In 1933, Jimmie Rodgers died young of tuberculosis symptoms. He was 35.</p>
                               
                                <p>The death of his idol was extremely upsetting for Ernest. However, it also made him realize that he was going to have to get serious about chasing his dreams. He moved to San Antonio, made a few guest appearances on a friend’s radio show and managed to secure his own early morning show, which aired twice a week. Not bad for a 19 year old kid.</p>                                   
                                
                                <p>But don’t get the wrong idea.</p>

                                <p>He was nowhere near the big time. And the pay was quite slim. E.T. had to keep two other jobs besides the radio gig. Some days, he was a ditch digger. Other days, a drug store clerk. Holding down three jobs at once was necessary to support himself and his young wife, Elaine. They didn’t waste any time before starting to have kids, either.</p>

                                <p>Ernest was more than happy to work hard if it kept him moving toward the life of his hero, Jimmie Rodgers.</p>

                                <p>He’d had this small picture of Jimmie for years now and it was in pretty bad shape. So he got a phone book and looked up the number for Jimmie Rodger’s widow, Carrie. He called her on the phone to explain that he was such a big fan and to see if she happened to have a bigger, better photo of Jimmie that Ernest could have.</p>
                                    
                                <p>Maybe even one that was autographed…</p>
                                    
                                <p>Carrie was super nice and said she did have such a photo that Ernest could have. She went so far as to invite him out to her house in Kerrville, TX, to get the picture. Ernest drove out there the next Sunday he wasn’t working, taking Elaine and baby Justin on the trip. They’d planned to stay for maybe ten minutes and ended up hanging out for over two hours – looking at costumes, guitars and pictures brought out by Mrs. Rodgers; hearing her stories about how high on the hog they’d lived merely a few years earlier. E.T could never have guessed when he woke up that morning that he’d be laying down to sleep that night having held Jimmie Rodgers’ signature Martin acoustic guitar with Jimmie’s name inlaid in pearl across the fretboard and the word “THANKS” written on the back – upside down – so Jimmie could flip it over to show audiences.</p>
                                    
                                <p>Choose your biggest dead hero and try to think of how you’d feel if a similar experience happened to you – it’s mind-blowing!</p>

                                <p>Okay, now add this on top of that…</p>

                                <p>A few months later, Carrie Rodgers called Ernest to say she’d listened for his radio show as he’d asked for her to do. On one hand, she offered to help E.T. out with the access she still had to music business big shots. On the other hand, she didn’t think he sounded like Jimmie Rodgers when he sang, which is basically the only thing in the world Ernest Tubb wanted to do in this phase of his life. And everyone around him had told him that’s exactly what he’d been doing this whole time…</p>

                                <p>Anyway, she still hooked E.T. up with Elsie McWilliams, the writer of a few great Jimmie Rodgers songs. Ernest Tubb made a couple of records that didn’t sell very well, did some touring and ended up back home – doing low paying radio again and working 2 or 3 side jobs like before. Driving around a beer truck was one of them, this time.</p>

                                <p>After a while back at home, Ernest had to have his tonsils taken out. He’d later say the doctors told him not to sing (or yodel) for a while after the surgery but he didn’t listen. Jumping right back into his normal routine re-injured his throat.</p>

                                <p>It changed his voice forever.</p>

                                <p>No more yodeling.</p>
                    
                            <h2>A New Voice</h2>
                                
                                <p>Ernest held a self-deprecating sense of humor about his new voice for the rest of his life. He loved to say that “9 out of 10 guys sitting in bars around the country could sing better” than he could.</p>

                                <p>I don’t know if he really believed that. It’s always been strange to me.</p>
                                    
                                <p>I think George Jones – indisputably, the greatest country singer in history – is exactly what happens when you add Ernest Tubb’s new singing style and Roy Acuff’s voice together. Now, George would have told you Hank Williams was his favorite singer but you don’t get Hank without Ernest and Roy. I’ve seen Lefty Frizzell named as an influence on George. Lefty borrowed from Ernest as well. However you want to say we got to George Jones, it always comes back to Roy Acuff and Ernest Tubb, two singers George did grow up listening to on the Grand Ole Opry</p>
               
                                <figure>

                                <p>Now, the part of Ernest you can hear in George is the tendency to hold on to a note for longer than you’d expect, picking the melody up and putting it back down in ways that are impossible to predict when hearing them sing a song for the first time – no matter if it’s a song you’ve heard performed by other people.</p>
                                    
                                <p>It’s possible Ernest really didn’t like his new voice…</p>
                                    
                                <p>About a million people disagree with his opinion.</p>
                                    
                                <p>He had that tonsillectomy in 1939. In 1940, he had his biggest hit, “Walking the Floor Over You.” The song is still synonymous with the name Ernest Tubb. If someone only knows one Ernest Tubb song, it’s usually this song.</p>
                                    
                                <p>E.T. was finally big time.</p>
                                    
                            <h2>A Helping Hand</h2>
                                    
                                <p>He joined the Grand Ole Opry in 1943 and formed the first incarnation of The Texas Troubadours. Tubb would stay working for the rest of his life, so members of the Texas Troubadours would be replaced every now and then. Buddy Emmons, Jack Greene, Billy Byrd, Leon Rhodes and Cal Smith were only some of the notable players who joined the band on their way up the ladder. This was the first way Ernest found to extend a helping hand to younger musicians like the hand Carrie Rodgers had held out to him…</p>

                                    Two words to sum up the career of Shelby Singleton? Publicity stunt. You think all it takes to make a hit record is to find a good song and get a good performance of it? That’s cute. Have a seat and let an old-school record man show you how it’s done. This is Shelby Singleton.

                        <h3>Buck Owens & Don Rich, Part 1: Open Up Your Heart</h3>
                            <h4>Season 1, Episode 10</h4>
                            <p>
                                Buck Owens is an inkblot test. Ask 20 different people, get 20 different Bucks. Whatever else is true (and some of it certainly is), today we’re talking about the one who brought hard country music to the world in a time when we desperately needed someone to do that. Sticking to that honky tonk sound from Bakersfield made him a very famous man. Shrewd business practices made him a very rich man. Both of these things made him more than a few enemies.
