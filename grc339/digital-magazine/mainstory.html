                                <h4>Really Got the Bull by the Horn</h4>
                                <p>Most Americans learn everything they know about bullfighting from Ernest Hemingway or Bugs Bunny. Daffy Duck played at being a matador in the 1947 cartoon Mexican Joyride but 1953’s Bully for Bugs is what everyone remembers. It’s one of the most-referenced Looney Tunes ever – the one where he misses the left turn at Albuquerque, says “stop steamin’ up my tail!” and “of course, you realize this means war…”</p>

                                <p>The story goes Chuck Jones was drawing a bull for some other clip when Eddie Selzer, head of Warner Brothers Cartoons, walked through the room, noticed what Chuck was drawing and loudly declared he didn’t want to see any cartoons about bullfights because bullfights were not funny. Since everyone knew Eddie Selzer was always wrong about everything, Chuck and a co-worker immediately booked a research trip to Mexico. The cheers and boos of the audience in the finished cartoon were recorded at an actual bullfight but the realism ends there. Not many people would have laughed at a documentary approach. See: Ernest Hemingway, who first met the bulls in the summer of 1923 right before he turned 24 years old.</p>

                                <p>Every year, a week before Hemingway’s July birthday, the city of Pamplona celebrates San Fermin, a nine-day festival with eight days of bulls. If you’ve ever seen pictures or videos of a “running of the bulls,” this is the biggest and most famous one. Most people who run with the bulls of San Fermin are tourists. When Orson Welles said Hemingway’s books ruined Spain by sending all these tourists, Orson neglected to point out he was one of those tourists, who went to Spain at the age of 18 after reading Hemingway. The protagonists of City Slickers are introduced as American thrill-seekers when the movie opens on their running with the bulls in Pamplona. After Billy Crystal gets a horn shoved up his ass, the movie follows him and his buddies to a doctor’s office. But if the action remained with the bulls, we’d see their run end at Pamplona’s bullring, where the bulls would be killed in front of an audience later in the day. During San Fermin, for eight days in a row, there’s a running every morning to transport bulls to the stadium for bullfights every afternoon. A man of Ernest Hemingway’s disposition would find pleasure in all of this, as well as other loud and chaotic traditions. During the festival, Pamplona is swarmed with people who fill the streets at all hours of the day and there are fireworks every night. Every year, one night of the festival is randomly selected as the night everyone goes outside and, one minute before midnight, begins making as much noise as they possibly can, which continues until dawn. From top to bottom, this is Hemingway’s kind of party. But it was the bulls which affected him more deeply and powerfully than any party ever could. Reading him on the topic feels like finding the diary of a person who’s discovered a new sexual fetish. His writing even makes it seem like he was aware of this and of the fact his new fetish hinged on torturing an animal for twenty minutes or so before slaughtering it in a needlessly stressful way. Hemingway himself called bullfighting indefensible. Still, he could not stay away. After his first San Fermin, the bulls brought him back the following year, when he witnessed a human casualty during one morning’s run, which is possibly why Hemingway never ran with the bulls. In 1925, he returned to Pamplona for a third consecutive year, by which time he considered these trips to be research for a non-fiction book on Spanish bullfighting. But then his small group of friends and tagalongs created so much drama Hemingway decided to write a fictionalized account of the trip as his first novel…</p>

                                <p>The Sun Also Rises was an immediate hit and changed American literature forever by stripping the story down to a skeleton of unheroic characters and unexplained events, delivering readers in the United States the effect of fact-based reporting from a distant world, a world which perhaps felt more “honest” or “real” than the inherited culture they were all-too-familiar with at home. Young Americans began dressing and grooming themselves to match their favorite characters from the book, then went down to their local hangouts wearing black berets and red scarves to practice their new personalities and offer opinions on bullfights and matadors they’d never seen. There were more of these opinions formed after Hemingway did publish a non-fiction book on bullfighting, Death in the Afternoon, in 1932. In 1959, Life magazine hired him to write a series of articles on bullfighting, which sent him back to Spain, where he found a professional rivalry between two matadors, Luis Miguel Dominguín, the superstar veteran trying to hold on to his torch rather than pass it down to his brother-in-law, Antonio Ordóñez, son of the man Hemingway used as inspiration for the great matador in The Sun Also Rises. Hemingway spent weeks watching these two men attempt to outdo each other with their performances in the ring and wrote over ten times the material he was hired to write for the magazine. His series of articles wound up being excerpts from yet another non-fiction book about bullfighting, The Dangerous Summer, which was finally published in 1985. Ever since The Sun Also Rises was first released, Hemingway’s most devoted readers made pilgrimages to Spain, to earn the right to complain about Hemingway ruining San Fermin with tourists and see for themselves the great Spanish tradition of the bullfight.</p>

                                <p>The “Bull-Leaping Fresco” from around 2000 BC seems to depict Greek daredevils using wild bulls in some type of Cirque du Soleil shenanigans but it’s difficult to tell what the humans are actually meant to be doing in this rudimentary and stylized painting. Could it possibly be a back hand spring off the spine of a charging bull? To say the least, it looks like a very dangerous combination of rodeo and gymnastics. A couple thousand years later, Julius Caesar, Nero and Claudius were all known to entertain the Roman masses by presenting staged hunts, running bulls into a stadium to be chased, attacked and killed by “hunters” on horseback. One way to think of modern Spanish bullfighting is as a combination of the Greeks’ artistic displays of fearlessness with the Romans’ ritual sacrifice celebrating humanity’s place at the top of the food chain. It is intended as a microcosmic allegory of the universal life force. However, early bullfights on the Iberian Peninsula in the Middle Ages were nothing more than a scaled-down version of the staged Roman hunt. And I’m going to keep calling it a bullfight because everyone does but the Spanish have never, then or now, considered this activity to be a fight or even a sport. What has been labeled a “bullfight” in English, is in Spanish la corrida de toros, the run of the bulls. This is a reference both to what happened once the bulls were in the ring and the aforementioned method of getting them there, which was the only way to transport a number of beef cattle on the Iberian peninsula in the Middle Ages. Before the days of refrigeration, ranch hands had to periodically run a few cattle from the fields into corrals near town to be butchered and sold as fresh meat at the local market. Whenever a major holiday or royal celebration (such as the birth of a prince) called for a feast, a greater number of cattle were run into town, announcing the beginning of festivities with the thunder of their hooves. Entering party mode, brave and/or foolish and/or drunken townsfolk began to run with the herd. I have no idea why people are still doing this in Pamplona today but, in the Middle Ages, entertainment was scarce, which is also the likely explanation for what they started doing to some of these bulls in the 5th century AD.</p>

                                <p>Before the days of arenas built specifically for bullfights, temporary bullrings were thrown together by corralling off a town square. Bleachers were built to seat commoners while property owners with buildings facing the plaza relinquished their balconies to seat the royal and noble classes. Inside the ring, knights on horseback demonstrated their riding skills while chasing or being chased by bulls and repeatedly stabbing the bulls with spears. All the while, servants, slaves or employees on foot helped direct bulls toward riders prepared to stab and away from unseated riders whenever a horse was inevitably gored to death. When an individual bull began to display signs of exhaustion after being run all over the ring and stabbed a bunch of times, el matador (or “the killer”) stepped in to execute the animal without delay, flourish or fanfare. For over a thousand years, matadors were just another helpful poor person on foot and the bullfight was simply a slaughterhouse job drawn out into bloody entertainment for the masses. The aristocracy, who owned these bulls and were killing many more outside the ring for meat, staged a production around the deaths of a few in order to give the people a little circus with their bread, thus reinforcing the big shots on horses in the ring and watching from balconies above as protective warriors and great providers. In this sense, you could say bullfighting on the Iberian peninsula was always political.</p>

                                    Buck Owens is an inkblot test. Ask 20 different people, get 20 different Bucks. Whatever else is true (and some of it certainly is), today we’re talking about the one who brought hard country music to the world in a time when we desperately needed someone to do that. Sticking to that honky tonk sound from Bakersfield made him a very famous man.                                </p>
