                    <h3>The Louvin Brothers: Running Wild</h3>
                    <h4>Season 1, Episode 6</h4>
                    <p>
                        The Louvin Brothers are widely regarded as the most influential harmony duo to ever cut a country song. The way Charlie and Ira could sing together is downright otherworldly. There’s even a special term we had to invent for family (it’s always/only family) who can sing this way: blood harmony. That being said, it’s possible we’ve never heard what they could really do.

                                    Two words to sum up the career of Shelby Singleton? Publicity stunt. You think all it takes to make a hit record is to find a good song and get a good performance of it? That’s cute. Have a seat and let an old-school record man show you how it’s done. This is Shelby Singleton.

                        <h3>Buck Owens & Don Rich, Part 1: Open Up Your Heart</h3>
                            <h4>Season 1, Episode 10</h4>
                            <p>
                                Buck Owens is an inkblot test. Ask 20 different people, get 20 different Bucks. Whatever else is true (and some of it certainly is), today we’re talking about the one who brought hard country music to the world in a time when we desperately needed someone to do that. Sticking to that honky tonk sound from Bakersfield made him a very famous man. Shrewd business practices made him a very rich man. Both of these things made him more than a few enemies.
