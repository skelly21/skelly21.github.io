               <p>Coastal Roast was founded in 2021 by two friends, Emily and Maria, who share a passion for coffee and a Southern California culture. Both life-long San Diegans have worked in the coffee industry for years and wanted to create a coffee shop based on community, sustainability, and quality. As a women-founded and owned business, Coastal Roast brings a fresh perspective to the coffee community.</p>

               <p>The location of Southern California played a significant role in the inspiration for Coastal Roast. The shop is loacted right along Coast Highway, in the center of the bustling beach community of Oceanside. The founders wanted to create a coffee shop that reflected the relaxed and friendly vibe of San Diego while also incorporating the unique flavors and ingredients of Columbia, Guatemala, Papa New Guinea, and Nicaragua, where we source our coffee beans. Coastal Roast sources its coffee beans from local farmers and roasts them in small batches to ensure freshness and quality.</p>
                  
               <p>At Coastal Roast, our mission is to create a community-driven coffee shop that celebrates the coastal lifestyle and the unique flavors of Southern California. We believe in sustainability and sourcing our ingredients from local farmers and suppliers whenever possible. We also believe in creating a welcoming and inclusive environment for everyone who walks through our doors. Whether you're a surfer, a beach-goer, a local resident, or just passing through, we want Coastal Roast to be your go-to spot for delicious coffee and community connection.</p>
